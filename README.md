Inventory is a RESTFul microservice in the eCommerce application

## :star: About Us

The Inventory resource is an integral micro-service of the eCommerce application. This micro-service is used to efficiently organize and manage products in the inventory for the proper functioning of the eCommerce application.

## :mag: Overview

The project's `/service` folder contains `models.py` file for the model and `routes.py` file for the service. The `/tests` folder has `test_models.py` and `test_routes.py` to test `models.py` and `routes.py` separately. The `/tests` folder also contains `factories.py` which can be used to generate a random Inventory record.


## Automatic Setup

The best way to use this repo is to start your own repo using it as a git template. To do this just press the green **Use this template** button in GitHub and this will become the source for your repository.

## Manual Setup

You can also clone this repository and then copy and paste the starter code into your project repo folder on your local computer. Be careful not to copy over your own `README.md` file so be selective in what you copy.

There are 4 hidden files that you will need to copy manually if you use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to copy files from this folder into your repo folder.

These should be copied using a bash shell as follows:

```bash
    cp .gitignore  ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .flaskenv ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .gitattributes ../<your_repo_folder>/
```
